# ansible-repro-unexpected-role-import
This repository is used to have a repo to provide repros for suspicious behaviour I experience using ansible. Will be used for myself to debug ansible, test PRs as well as share playbooks as repro recipe with the community (#irc members for example). 

Do not use any code from this repo for your production playbooks unless you really know what you're doing and know for sure that you know the impact or side-effects.
